This project is an Excel-based board evaluation system designed for Scrabble games. It predicts the game's possible outcome by analyzing key factors such as tile distribution, board leverage, and score progression at different stages of the game.

📊 How It Works:
The model uses numerical values for various board and player conditions to estimate which player has the advantage during a Scrabble match.

📝 Factors Included:
Number of Tiles on Board: Total number of letter tiles placed on the board.
Number of Tiles with Players: Number of tiles still held by the players.
Double Word Squares Remaining: Count of double word score spots left on the board.
Triple Word Squares Remaining: Count of triple word score spots left on the board.
Leverage Differential: Difference in board advantage opportunities between players.
Score at Start, Middle, and End: Points recorded at different phases of the game.
Winning & Losing Scores: Projected final scores to evaluate possible outcomes.

📌 Usage:
Open the Excel file and input the current game values in the provided cells for each factor. The model then helps you analyze the board situation and predict which player holds the advantage based on Scrabble board dynamics.
